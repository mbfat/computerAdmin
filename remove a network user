Assuming Windows 10 and that you are logged in as a local administrator -- not the user that you want to delete:

    Open Window Settings
    Search for Advanced System Settings and open "View Advanced System Settings".
    Click Settings in the User Profiles section. Image: post content
    Select the User Profile that you want to remove and click Delete.  Deleting the profile can take some time.  Be patient.
